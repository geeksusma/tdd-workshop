TDD Workshop to support my speech at apipana.io

## Requirements to implement:

- We want to save an employee

- The Personal Data (Name and Last Name) is mandatory and can't be
empty

- The Id will be fixed by the System (not the persistence layer)

- Ensure the Employee is not duplicated, use the passport to ensure that
validation

## Assumptions to implement:
Assume the Controller Layer/Presentation/Upper Layer is already implemented
